# Differential Equation Genetic Algorithm solver

The implementation presented here is in part adapted from [this paper by I. G. Tsoulos & I. E. Lagaris](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10710-006-7009-y).

## Getting started

The project can be opened and built as is with Visual Studio 2019 on Windows, or compiled with gcc through `make` (C++14).
